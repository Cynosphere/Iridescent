## Modules

### Chair
Adds a Comfy Chair which makes time go very fast if everyone online is sitting
in one.

### Clear Water
Makes water less murky. Overrides grass spread to prevent it from spreading
underwater, which is a problem other clear water tweaks have.

### Instant Pickup
Makes items and experience enter your inventory instantly when killing mobs or
breaking blocks, if you have space for it.

### Obelisk
Disables beds and adds Obelisks to the world that let you set your spawn.

### Pale
Adds a 'Pale' potion effect conferred by rotten flesh that makes you allergic to
sunlight.

### Resize Helper
Shows the current window size in the top-left when resizing the window.

### Spirit Graves
The flagship module. Adds entity-based spirit graves that can be moved by looking at
them, to pull them away from hazards, and that support "displacing" your inventory so
you don't have to reorganize your items every time you die. Plus they look really
cool.

### Stoned
Replaces vanilla stone tools with variants specific to granite, andesite, diorite, and
cobblestone.
